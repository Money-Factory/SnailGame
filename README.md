# SnailGame

Fitness tracker where immortal snail slowly approaches towards you

## Prerequisites

- Install node LTS (v20.11.1)

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is with a devcontainer in VS Code. Install docker and VS Code then:

1. Open the project in VS Code and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" from the command bar
1. Once the container is built, run `npm run start:tunnel" in the terminal in VS Code
1. Scan the generated QR code with the Expo app on your mobile device

Otherwise if you wish to run the project without a devcontainer, perform the following:

1. Clone the repo
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Run `npm start` to start the project
1. Scan the generated QR code with the Expo app on your mobile device
